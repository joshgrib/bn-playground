# bn-play
## A tool for learning and interfacing with Bayesian Networks
> Josh Gribbon

--

### TODO
* [_] Test with light mode as a backup

--

--
Why should I care?
* Philosophical basis - causality is important to know how to intervene
* People not understanding statistics seems to lead to a lot of drama and confusion
* Can affect regular daily decisions, legislature, etc
--

### Bayesian Networks review

Some stuff

--
What it can't show with causality
--

### Possible future work

* Import/export
* d-seperation, d-connection
* More
